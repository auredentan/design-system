# LumApps Design System

## Project installation

[Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended to launch the project. Check out the [official installation documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if not installed.

### Install project dependencies

Note that `@mdi/js` is defined as `devDependencies`. This is a way to make dev server usage easier because [`@lumx/icons`](./src/icons) needs it.

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### To start dev servers

```bash
# For angular-js dev server
npm run start:angular-js

# For react dev server
npm run start:react
```
